# Problem Statement:

You are given a list of integers representing the scores of students in a class. Each score is between 0 and 100. You need to implement a function **top_n_scores(scores, n)** that takes the list of scores and an integer **n** as input and returns the top **n** scores in descending order.

# Challenge Constraints:

- You must solve this problem without using any built-in sorting functions

# Future Improvements:

- Front-end implementation
- Input validation (e.g. scores must be integers)
