# Problem Statement:

As a teacher you want to automate how you analyze student performance on exam scores. Each score is between 0 and 100. You decide to implement a function **top_scores(scores, n)** that accepts a list of assignment *scores* and an integer *n* as inputs and returns the top *n* scores in descending order.

## Challenge Constraints:

- You must solve this problem without using any built-in sorting functions

## Future Improvements:

This project has a small scope. Additional features and complexities may be added by considering the information below:

- Front-end: implement web application
- Back-end: login authentication/authorization
- Data: store data into a database, use visualization tools, provide further details (e.g. student names, class block)
