# Learning-to-Code

I use this repository to document what I am learning to code. Sometimes, this involves sharing lessons learned from books, online courses, hackathon events, and more. When appropriate, I edit the original code I share to avoid copyright issues. Join me as I share my progress, one challenge at a time, in this collaborative learning space.
