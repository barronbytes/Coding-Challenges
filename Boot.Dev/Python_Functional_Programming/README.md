# Python Functional Programming

This learning module from [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/), along with my personal studies, covers the following topics:

* __Core concepts:__ pure functions, immutability, first-class functions, higher-order functions, memoization, recursion
* __Techniques:__ map(), filter(), reduce()

## Personal Additions

In addition to completing the required modules from Boot.Dev, I created my own questions that combined concepts from multiple lessons. This approach helped me reinforce my knowledge and improve my problem-solving abilities. You can find the filenames of the questions I created below, with each one including unit tests in this repository for review.

* __sum_chars_by_doc_word_length.py :__ The program accepts as input a string. The methods map(), filter(), and reduce() are used to process the document. The program returns an integer for a character count that meets a certain criteria.
