# Boot.Dev

As an aspiring developer, I have found [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/) to be an invaluable online resource. The platform provides a structured learning path for back-end development, removing the mystery of what to learn first and next. The site makes learning enjoyable and rewarding with hands-on coding exercises and guided projects in various programming languages.

## Personal Additions

In addition to completing the required modules from Boot.Dev, I created my own questions that combined concepts from multiple lessons. This approach helped me reinforce my knowledge and improve my problem-solving abilities. You can find the filenames of the questions I created below, with each one including unit tests in this repository for review.

* **sum_chars_by_doc_word_length.py :** The program accepts as input a string. The methods map(), filter(), and reduce() are used to process the document. The program returns an integer for a character count that meets a certain criteria.
